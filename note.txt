29/10: 
    - Fix error: turning in the wrong direction (cmd_vel node-wrong inverse kine formula)
    - Make the motor stop in the unsafety range


31/10:
    - Integrate servo with sensor  // not done
    - Can't make command to robot if it's in safety distance => solved  // not done
    - Idea: ros2 always has the prioritized rights to control robot in all situations even when the servo is working 
    - Errors: when the motor is initialized for the first time (when spd(0,0)), servo still rotates => only rotate after running and detecting the object

    Note: 
        - Non-blocking technique: ensure that motor PID keeps working and maintain the Serial communication being not blocked and updated while the servo is rotating
        - Reactive Programming
        - Timer conflict in Arduino board.
    
1/11:
    - Can detect the object
    - When object is in the unsafety zone (<20cm) => can control to turn right or left or move backward
    - Servo can rotate and measure the left, middle, right distance
    
    - Error:
        - Can't control servo intentionally
        - Servo does not work anymore after the first time
        - Servo always work once right after launching the file

2/11: 
    - Task: how it works if left and right distances are both smaller than 20
        + Proposal: first robot move backward (need to calculate how far it will move), then stop (arduino receives the stop command => switch to sweeping mode => run servo => send the left, right and control)

4/11:
    - after the stop command (k) => whatever the next command is, servo always get triggered because it receives the SPD;0;0;
    - after it detects the obstacle => stop => only after the obstacle is removed, robots continues to work and trigger the servo simultaneously 
            => need to solve: it should trigger the servo right after it stops to know which the next direction  
            => solution: State Mechanism

Issues: 
    - lack of PWM pin in Arduino and Servo and D10 use the same timer => switch 10 to 11 and 11 to 7
